    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    the box model is a way to describe how css wraps formatting around and within elements with margin being outside the border and padding 
    being inside the border for spacing with the content in the middle. because padding and margins can be added to specifically sized elements 
    it can interrupt the intended formatting or flow of the design but can be fixed using the box-sizing:border-box and can be fixed for all browsers
    using the code:
    /* apply a natural box layout model to all elements */
*, *:before, *:after {
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;
}
